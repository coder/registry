## Introduction
### What is the Amazon Q + AgentAPI Integration?
The Amazon Q + AgentAPI integration extends the Amazon Q module to support Coder Tasks through the AgentAPI framework. This allows users to create and manage tasks through the Coder UI, interact with Amazon Q via a web chat interface, monitor task progress in real-time, and leverage Amazon Q's AI capabilities for coding and research tasks.

### Key Features
- **Real-time Task Reporting**: Tasks appear in the Coder UI with live status updates
- **Web Chat Interface**: Interactive chat with Amazon Q through AgentAPI
- **Aider Integration**: Enhanced coding assistance with Aider
- **Multi-task Support**: Handle both coding and research tasks
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for network and API failures

### Benefits
- Streamlined workflow within the Coder environment
- Improved visibility into AI-assisted task progress
- Enhanced collaboration between human developers and AI assistants
- Reduced context switching between tools

## Architecture
### System Components
The system architecture consists of three main components: the Coder UI, AgentAPI, and Amazon Q. The Coder UI contains a Tasks module for task management and Status updates for real-time progress tracking. AgentAPI provides a Web Chat interface for user interaction and a Task handler for processing tasks. Amazon Q contains AI Logic for processing requests and Aider integration for enhanced coding assistance.

### Data Flow
1. **Task Creation**: User creates a task in the Coder UI
2. **Task Dispatch**: Coder sends the task to AgentAPI
3. **Task Processing**: AgentAPI forwards the task to Amazon Q
4. **Status Updates**: Amazon Q sends progress updates back through AgentAPI to Coder
5. **Task Completion**: Results are displayed in the Coder UI

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Coder instance with Tasks enabled
- AgentAPI installed (v0.3.3 or higher)
- Amazon Q CLI installed
- Node.js or Python runtime (depending on environment)

### Step 1: Install AgentAPI
Install AgentAPI using npm for npm-based environments or pip for Python environments.

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
Set environment variables for AgentAPI including endpoint URL, API key, and Coder instance URL. For Amazon Q, enable AgentAPI integration and configure AWS credentials including access key ID, secret access key, and region.

### Step 3: Update Amazon Q Module
Navigate to the Amazon Q module directory and install the AgentAPI integration using either npm or pip.

### Step 4: Configure Coder Tasks
Update your Coder configuration to include Amazon Q as a task provider with appropriate endpoint, API key, AWS region, and credentials.

## Configuration
### AgentAPI Configuration
Create or update the AgentAPI configuration file with endpoint URL, API key, instance URL, timeout settings, retry count, and module-specific settings for Amazon Q including its path and AWS configuration.

### Amazon Q Module Configuration
Update the Amazon Q module configuration file with AgentAPI settings, AWS settings, tasks settings, and Aider settings.

## Usage Guide
### Creating Tasks
#### Via Coder UI
Navigate to the Tasks section in your Coder instance, click "New Task", select "Amazon Q" as the task provider, enter your task description, choose task type (Coding or Research), configure additional parameters, and submit the task.

#### Programmatically
Instantiate the Amazon Q module with its configuration, define a task object with type, description, language, framework, and files, then call the createTask method.

### Monitoring Task Progress
Tasks appear in the Coder UI with real-time status updates showing Queued (waiting to be processed), Processing (Amazon Q is working on the task), Completed (task has been finished), or Failed (task encountered an error).

### Using the Web Chat Interface
Open the AgentAPI web interface, select the Amazon Q module, and start chatting with Amazon Q for assistance. Available commands include /help for help, /status to check current task status, and /cancel to cancel the current task.

### Aider Integration
For coding tasks, Amazon Q integrates with Aider to provide enhanced coding assistance by defining a task with type, description, and Aider-specific settings including enabled status, files to work with, auto-commit preference, and commit message.

## API Reference
### AgentAPI Integration
#### Initialization
Initialize AgentAPI using the constructor with configuration parameters.

#### Task Management
Methods include createTask to create a new task, updateTask to update task status, completeTask to mark a task as completed, and cancelTask to cancel a task.

#### Web Chat Interface
Provides sendMessage to send messages and an event listener for receiving messages.

### Amazon Q Module
#### Task Processing
Methods include processTask to process a task, getTaskStatus to retrieve task status, and getTaskResult to get task results.

#### Configuration
Methods include updateConfig to update configuration settings and getConfig to get current configuration.

## Demo Instructions
### Running the Demo
Navigate to the demo directory, install dependencies using npm, configure environment variables by copying the example file and editing it with your configuration, then run the demo using npm start.

### Demo Features
The demo showcases creating tasks in the Coder UI, real-time status updates, web chat interaction with Amazon Q, Aider integration for coding tasks, and error handling and recovery.

### Demo Video
A short video demonstrating the integration is available at a provided link.

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
#### 1. AgentAPI Connection Errors
**Symptom**: Tasks fail to start or update status.
**Solution**: Verify AgentAPI is running and accessible, check network connectivity between Coder and AgentAPI, ensure API keys are valid and correctly configured, and check AgentAPI version (0.3.3+ required).

#### 2. Amazon Q CLI Not Found
**Symptom**: Tasks fail with "Amazon Q CLI not found" error.
**Solution**: Ensure Amazon Q CLI is installed and in PATH, verify the installation path in the module configuration, and check AWS credentials and region settings.

#### 3. Task Status Not Updating
**Symptom**: Tasks appear stuck in "Processing" state.
**Solution**: Check AgentAPI logs for errors, verify the AgentAPI version (0.3.3+ required), ensure the Coder instance can communicate with AgentAPI, and check network connectivity and firewall settings.

#### 4. Web Chat Interface Not Loading
**Symptom**: AgentAPI web interface fails to load or connect.
**Solution**: Check AgentAPI service status, verify web interface configuration, check browser console for errors, and ensure CORS is properly configured.

### Debugging
Enable debug logging by setting environment variables for Amazon Q, AgentAPI, and Coder debug modes. Logs can be checked in Coder server logs, AgentAPI logs, and Amazon Q module logs.

### Getting Help
Join the Discord community, open an issue in the repository, or check the documentation for known issues.
