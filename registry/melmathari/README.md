# About Me

👨‍💻 Learning by contributing in Open Source.

Software engineer, no-code nerd, teacher, and always ready to try something new. Based in the Netherlands, I'm a no-code advocate who loves building tools and launching products that make a difference. Whether I'm coding, mentoring, or experimenting, I aim to keep things simple and impactful. I'm a big fan of breaking down complex problems into straightforward solutions—one idea at a time.
